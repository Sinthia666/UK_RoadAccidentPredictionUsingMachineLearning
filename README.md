# UK_RoadAccidentPredictionUsingMachineLearning










In this project, traditional machine learning models were used to analyze the severity of
traffic accidents. The dataset was first preprocessed using techniques such as data clean- ing,
feature engineering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The preprocessed dataset was
then standardized and balanced using oversampling techniques. After the preprocessing
steps, the data was split into training and testing sets. Various traditional machine learning
models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vec- tor Machine (SVM)
and etc were trained and tested on the dataset. The performance of these models was
evaluated based on various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-
score. The results of the analysis showed that SVM with Grid Search, Gradient Boosting
Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier are the best models the best among all models, achieving
an accuracy of 75%. Overall, this project demon- strates the efficacy of traditional machine
learning models and neural network models in analyzing traffic accident severity.
